# Web Cloaking & Conditional Content Delivery Research

## 1. Fundamental Definition

### What Web Cloaking Means
At its core, **web cloaking** is the practice of presenting different content or URLs to different users (or user agents) under the same requested URL. Conceptually, it is a form of conditional content delivery where the decision logic heavily depends on identifying the requester's nature or intent.

### Historical Meaning
Historically, the term "cloaking" originated in the context of Search Engine Optimization (SEO). It described deceptive techniques where a web server would identify search engine crawlers (like Googlebot) and serve them a highly optimized, keyword-rich page, while serving human visitors a completely different page (often visually appealing but sparse in text, or containing entirely different affiliate content). 

### Cloaking vs. Conditional Content Delivery
The underlying mechanism for cloaking is identical to **conditional content delivery** (e.g., personalization, localization, responsive design). The distinction is primarily intent and transparency:
- **Legitimate Conditional Delivery**: Aims to improve user experience based on context (e.g., showing a mobile layout to a phone, translating text for a French IP).
- **Cloaking**: Aims to deceive a specific class of requester (like a crawler, a security scanner, or an ad reviewer) by showing them a compliant or optimized version of a resource while showing a different (often non-compliant or restricted) version to the target audience.

### Dimensions of Cloaking
- **Server-side vs. Client-side**: 
  - *Server-side*: The server makes the decision before sending the HTTP response. The client only ever receives one version of the HTML.
  - *Client-side*: The server sends a uniform payload (usually JavaScript), and the client-side code makes decisions on what to render based on browser state or subsequent API calls.
- **Static vs. Dynamic**:
  - *Static*: Pre-computed rules routing traffic to distinct static files.
  - *Dynamic*: The application dynamically compiles the response per request.
- **Request-time vs. Session-based**:
  - *Request-time*: Decision made purely on the single HTTP request's headers and IP.
  - *Session-based*: Decision relies on established state (cookies, local storage, previous request history).
- **Deterministic vs. Probabilistic**:
  - *Deterministic*: If condition X is met, always serve Y.
  - *Probabilistic*: Serve Y to X% of users matching condition Z (often used in A/B testing or evading simple detection).

## 2. Core Mathematical Model

```text
Response = F(Request, Environment, State, Configuration)
```

### Components
1. **Request (R)**: The explicit data sent by the client. Includes URL, HTTP method, headers (User-Agent, Accept), and body.
2. **Environment (E)**: Contextual data derived from the network. Includes IP address, inferred geolocation, ISP/ASN, and TCP/IP stack fingerprints.
3. **State (S)**: Data persisting across requests. Includes session identifiers, cookies, user account data, and database records of past behavior.
4. **Configuration (C)**: The server's internal rules, routing logic, feature flags, and deployment state.
5. **Decision Logic (F)**: The algorithm processing R, E, S, C to map to an output.
6. **Response (Res)**: The resulting HTTP status code, headers, and body payload.

### Conditional Response Functions
A conditional response function has decision boundaries. For example:

```text
F(R, E) = 
  Res_mobile   if R_UA matches mobile regex
  Res_desktop  otherwise
```

By changing the environment (E_ip from US to France), the output shifts from Res_english to Res_french. If a system models scanners separately, the boundary becomes:

```text
F(R, E) = 
  Res_clean    if E_ASN in CloudProviders
  Res_payload  otherwise
```

## 3. Complete Web Architecture

Conditional content selection can occur at multiple layers:

```
Internet
  │
  ▼
DNS: Can return different IP addresses based on the requester's subnet (GeoDNS)
  │
  ▼
CDN / Edge: Can route requests, serve different cached objects, or run edge compute
  │
  ▼
Load Balancer: Can route traffic to different backend clusters based on rules (path or IP)
  │
  ▼
Reverse Proxy / WAF: Inspects payloads. Can block, redirect, or rewrite requests
  │
  ▼
Application Server: Executes business logic
  │
  ▼
Decision Layer (Rules Engine): Evaluates F(R, E, S, C)
  │
  ▼
Database / Cache: Provides data needed for the decision (rules, IP threat feeds)
  │
  ▼
HTML Generation: Renders server-side response (or prepares reverse proxy stream)
  │
  ▼
JavaScript (Browser): Executes client-side logic and DOM updates
  │
  ▼
Final User Experience: What the user actually sees
```

Each layer has its own visibility. DNS only sees IP subnets. The application server sees HTTP headers. JavaScript sees the local device environment.

## 4. Server-Side Cloaking

### Lifecycle
```
Client Request ➔ Request Parsing ➔ Signal Extraction ➔ Classification ➔ Rule Evaluation ➔ Content Selection ➔ Response Generation ➔ Caching / Streaming ➔ Delivery
```

### Decision Inputs (Signals)

1. **IP Address & ASN**:
   - *What*: Network origin.
   - *Legitimate use*: Geo-blocking for compliance, localized pricing.
   - *Limitations*: IP databases require frequent updates. NAT means multiple users can share one IP.
2. **User-Agent (UA)**:
   - *What*: String identifying the browser/OS.
   - *Legitimate use*: Serving polyfills to older browsers, mobile layouts.
   - *Limitations*: Easily spoofed; client hints are replacing it.
3. **HTTP Headers (Accept-Language, Sec-CH-UA)**:
   - *What*: Client preferences and browser security hints.
   - *Legitimate use*: Auto-translating pages, fine-grained device optimization.
4. **Referrer**:
   - *What*: The URL the user clicked from.
   - *Legitimate use*: Analytics, customized landing page greetings.
   - *Limitations*: Often stripped by privacy features (`Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`).
5. **Cookies / Session State**:
   - *What*: Tokens indicating previous interactions or authentication.
   - *Legitimate use*: Showing a user's dashboard vs. a login screen.

## 5. Client-Side Cloaking

Instead of the server deciding, the server sends a generic HTML page equipped with JavaScript that evaluates the environment *after* delivery.

### Flow
```
Initial HTML ➔ JavaScript Execution ➔ Fingerprint / API Request ➔ Response Payload ➔ DOM Modification ➔ Final Rendered Page
```

### Mechanisms
- **DOM Manipulation**: JavaScript reads browser properties (e.g., `navigator.language`, `screen.width`) and alters the DOM.
- **Asynchronous API Calls (Fetch/XHR)**: The client requests a configuration file or data payload. The API might return different data based on IP.
- **Dynamic Imports**: Loading specific modules only if certain conditions are met.

The initial HTML (what a simple curl command sees) and the final rendered experience (what a real user sees) can differ vastly, making detection harder for non-JavaScript-enabled scanners.

---

## 6. Browser and Environment Signals

### Browser Identification
Techniques to determine the exact client context:
- **Client Hints**: Structured HTTP headers replacing the User-Agent string.
- **Device Class**: Desktop, Mobile, Tablet, VR headset.
- **Rendering Capabilities**: WebGL availability, canvas APIs.

### Browser Fingerprinting
Instead of relying on declared identifiers (User-Agent), fingerprinting relies on intrinsic physical and software characteristics.

```
Signals (Fonts, Canvas hash, Audio API hash) ➔ Feature Collection ➔ Feature Vector ➔ Classification
```

**Limitations**: Fingerprints drift over time as users update browsers. Privacy extensions (e.g., Brave browser, Tor) intentionally randomize or normalize fingerprints, reducing accuracy.

---

## 7. IP and Network-Level Concepts

Network information is a primary input for conditional delivery:
- **IP Addresses**: Logical network addresses.
- **Proxies / VPNs / Tor**: Conceal the true origin IP. A request from a VPN IP implies the user's geographic intent is masked.
- **Datacenter vs. Residential**: Datacenter IPs (AWS, DigitalOcean, Hetzner) are typically used by servers, bots, and corporate VPNs. Residential IPs (Comcast, AT&T, Deutsche Telekom) are used by human consumers.

Classification relies on mapping IPs to Autonomous Systems (ASNs) and Geo-IP databases. It is imperfect because IPs change hands, and corporate networks blend with consumer endpoints.

---

## 8. HTTP-Level Differences

Different responses can be legitimately produced using HTTP semantics:
- **Content Negotiation**: Client sends `Accept: application/json` vs `Accept: text/html`. Server responds accordingly.
- **Vary Header**: `Vary: User-Agent` tells downstream caches that the response is conditional on the UA.
- **Authorization**: `401 Unauthorized` vs `200 OK` based on the `Authorization` header.
- **Status Codes**: Redirects (`301`, `302`, `307`) send users to localized or tailored destinations.

---

## 9. Redirect-Based Architecture

Concept: `URL A ➔ HTTP Redirect ➔ URL B ➔ Application Logic ➔ Final URL`

- **301/308**: Permanent redirects. Caches remember these permanently.
- **302/307**: Temporary redirects. Essential for logic that changes frequently (e.g., A/B tests, dynamic offer rotation).
- **JavaScript Navigation**: `window.location.href = '...'`. Invisible to HTTP-only clients, requires JS execution.

Redirect chains allow state to be accumulated (e.g., passing affiliate IDs as URL parameters) and logic to be evaluated at different physical servers before landing the user.

---

## 10. CDN and Edge-Level Conditional Delivery

Modern CDNs (Cloudflare, Fastly, Akamai) operate at the network edge:
- **Edge Computing**: Execution of V8 isolates or WebAssembly at the CDN layer. They can intercept a request, check a fast key-value store, and return a response without hitting the origin server.
- **Cache Keys**: Normally, `URL = Cache Key`. Edge functions can rewrite the cache key. For example, creating a key `URL + CountryCode` to cache different versions per country.

Because the edge intercepts traffic before the origin, CDN behavior can resemble cloaking (e.g., a security scanner in US-East sees the CDN's generic block page, while a user in Europe sees the origin's content).

---

## 11. Database and Application-Level Decisions

The application layer makes deep context decisions:
```
Request ➔ User/Context Lookup ➔ Business Rules ➔ Selected Representation
```

Examples:
- **Feature Flags**: Enabling a new UI for 10% of users.
- **Subscription Status**: Premium users see no ads; free users see ads.
- **Pricing Rules**: Dynamic pricing based on inventory or past purchase history.

---

## 12. Personalization vs Cloaking

| Concept | Intent | Transparency | Target |
|---------|--------|--------------|--------|
| **Personalization** | Enhance UX based on preference | High (User expects it) | End User |
| **A/B Testing** | Optimize metrics | Moderate (Temporary) | End User (Segmented) |
| **Localization** | Serve relevant language/currency | High | End User (Geographic) |
| **Cloaking** | Deceive monitoring/auditing | Low (Hidden) | Crawlers / Scanners |

While the *math* is the same ($F(R)$ yields different outputs), the *semantics* differ based on intent and the classification of the observer.

---

## 13. SEO Cloaking

**Model**:
- Search-engine crawler ➔ Representation A (Keyword stuffed, fast text)
- Ordinary visitor ➔ Representation B (Flashy UI, image heavy)

Search engines mandate content consistency because their goal is to index the web *as a user experiences it*. If the index doesn't match the user experience, search quality degrades. As search engines evolved to render JavaScript and look at layout, SEO cloaking became harder, shifting from simple UA-sniffing to complex IP and behavioral classification.

---

## 14. Advertising Context

In online ads, consistency is required between:
```
Ad Creative ➔ Landing URL ➔ Landing Page ➔ Checkout
```

Platforms enforce this to prevent bait-and-switch tactics (e.g., advertising a family product but landing on a restricted-age product). If the landing page conditional logic detects the Ad Reviewer's IP/bot and serves a compliant page, while serving the real ad traffic the restricted product, it constitutes advertising cloaking.

---

## 15. Detection Theory

Detection is a problem of **differential observation**.
Given:
- Environment A (Clean residential IP, standard browser) ➔ Response A
- Environment B (Datacenter IP, headless browser) ➔ Response B

If $Response A \neq Response B$, conditional logic exists.
Comparison dimensions include:
- **Network**: HTTP status codes, redirect chains.
- **Payload**: HTML structure (DOM tree diffs), text content.
- **Visual**: Screenshots, structural similarity (SSIM).
- **Behavioral**: Network requests triggered post-load, API responses.

---

## 16. Differential Testing

```
Baseline ➔ Controlled Variable Change ➔ Second Observation ➔ Comparison ➔ Attribution
```

If you change the User-Agent *and* the IP address simultaneously and observe a change, you cannot attribute the change to a specific variable (Ambiguity). Controlled experimental design isolates variables (e.g., same IP, different UA) to map the decision boundaries of the target server's $F(R, E, S, C)$.

---

## 17. State and Temporal Behavior

Web applications are stateful over time:
- **Time T1** ➔ Response A (Out of stock)
- **Time T2** ➔ Response B (In stock)

**Temporal Cloaking**: Changing content based on the time of day, or the time relative to an ad campaign's approval status. A single observation cannot establish the complete behavior of a web application; longitudinal observation is required.

---

## 18. Caching Considerations

Caching can mimic cloaking:
If User A requests a page while the server is throwing a 500 Error, the CDN might cache the 500 error.
User B (the scanner) requests the page and gets the cached 500 error. The server is now fixed. User C requests a different URL and gets a 200 OK. 
Without understanding cache keys, `Cache-Control`, and `ETag`, differential observations might yield false positives for cloaking.

---

## 19. Multi-Layer Cloaking

Complex systems stack conditional logic:
1. **CDN (Layer 1)**: Routes traffic to a US server or an EU server based on Geo-IP.
2. **Reverse Proxy (Layer 2)**: Blocks known bad bots (Datacenter IPs).
3. **Application (Layer 3)**: Serves a localized layout.
4. **JavaScript (Layer 4)**: Fetches dynamic pricing via API.

If an observer tries to map the system, they must account for combinations of all 4 layers intersecting.

---

## 20. Limitations of Detection

Detecting conditional behavior is fundamentally an **attribution problem**:
- **False Positives**: A/B tests, geographic localized pricing, or a CDN cache hit vs. miss can look like cloaking.
- **Dynamic Websites**: No two requests to a modern social media feed are identical. Differentiating structural cloaking from expected dynamic content variation is mathematically complex.
- **Asynchronous Execution**: The DOM settles at different times depending on network speed, making visual comparisons flaky.

---

## 21. Formal Taxonomy

| Dimension | Categories |
|-----------|------------|
| **Locus of Decision** | DNS, CDN, Edge Compute, Reverse Proxy, Application Server, Client JavaScript |
| **Decision Inputs** | Network (IP, ASN), Request (Headers), Identity (Cookies, Auth), Device (Screen, OS), Geography, Time, Session state |
| **Output Variance** | Content (HTML), URL (Redirects), Headers (Cache/Cookies), Scripts (JS bundles), API Data, DOM structure |

---

## 22. Real-World Architecture Patterns

- **Pattern A (Geo-Localization)**: Client IP ➔ Geo-IP Database ➔ If EU, serve GDPR banner and EUR currency; Else serve USD.
- **Pattern B (Adaptive Delivery)**: Client Hints ➔ Edge determines mobile device ➔ Proxies to `m.domain.com` or rewrites HTML to mobile-optimized variant.
- **Pattern C (A/B Testing)**: Client requests ➔ Application generates random assignment ➔ Sets cookie `experiment=B` ➔ Returns variant B. Future requests read cookie.
- **Pattern D (Bot Management)**: Reverse Proxy inspects TLS fingerprint and IP reputation ➔ High risk triggers challenge; Low risk passes to application.

---

## 23. Historical Evolution

1. **Early Web (1990s)**: Simple User-Agent sniffing for browser compatibility (Netscape vs. IE).
2. **SEO Era (2000s)**: Server-side IP and UA matching to feed search engine crawlers keyword-stuffed static HTML.
3. **Dynamic Web (2010s)**: Rise of CDNs and complex load balancers. Conditional delivery became standard for localization and performance.
4. **Modern Era (2020s)**: Shift to Client-Side Rendering (SPAs) and Edge Compute. Decisions are made using advanced browser fingerprinting and JavaScript execution, blurring the line between application logic and conditional cloaking.

---

## 24. Glossary

- **Cloaking**: Presenting different content to different users under the same URL, typically with deceptive intent.
- **Conditional Serving**: The legitimate technical mechanism of serving different responses based on context.
- **Fingerprinting**: Aggregating numerous client attributes to create a unique identifier without relying on stateful cookies.
- **Cache Key**: The unique identifier a CDN uses to store and retrieve a cached response (usually the URL, but can include headers).
- **CSR (Client-Side Rendering)**: Generating the DOM in the browser using JavaScript rather than on the server.
- **Hydration**: The process of attaching interactivity (event listeners) to a server-rendered HTML payload in the browser.
- **Differential Testing**: Comparing outputs by systematically varying inputs to reverse-engineer decision boundaries.

## 25. Final Mental Model

**The Unified Model of Web Delivery:**

```
Inputs (Request, Network, Client Context)
  │
  ▼
Signal Extraction
  │
  ▼
Classification (Is Bot? Is Mobile? Is France?)
  │
  ▼
Decision Engine (Apply Rules)
  │
  ▼
Representation Selection
  │
  ▼
Delivery Layer (CDN / Cache / Stream)
  │
  ▼
Client Execution (JS / DOM)
  │
  ▼
Final Experience
```

**Mapping to Use Cases:**
1. **Traditional Websites**: The Decision Engine is minimal. Delivery relies heavily on caching.
2. **Modern SPAs**: Representation Selection returns an empty shell. Client Execution does the heavy lifting via API calls.
3. **SEO Cloaking**: Classification identifies "Googlebot". Decision Engine bypasses SPA logic and returns pre-rendered, optimized HTML.
4. **Advertising**: Classification identifies ad review systems. Decision Engine returns compliant content, while Client Execution for real users alters the DOM to show the actual offer.
